# Smartable
## Project Background and Description

Timetabling is a difficult problem, which is an element belonging to the field of Scheduling. Scheduling is a NP hard problem as it is defined as an allocation of resources over time. The classes and lecture timetable problems are usually solved by hand and takes several days or weeks to repair based on feedback, clashes, credit requirements and personal interests etc. The main problem is the variety of classes to choose from that don’t clash between subjects and lecture timings. In most cases students aren’t aware of the interesting course they can balance in their schedule while completing the credit requirements. Due to the lack of information and analytical tools students don’t tend to apply for courses that would be a better fit for them and drop the courses they don’t like. This creates a problem of blocked seats and unhappy response from the student’s side.
## Our solution
Our website addresses the above problem by developing a flexible timetable maker that is personally accustomed to each student according to their year, core, batch, personal preferences like minor etc. We developed an open-ended program for all where the courses could be arranged around set time slots and satisfy constraints that are individual to each student. The timetable maker helps save time and energy of students and faculty by suggesting them with a schedule.
